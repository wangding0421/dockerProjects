IMPORTANT NOTICE: This whole docker image and hadoop cluster building process is based on environment under Ubuntu15:04 or MacOS. Therefore may encounter connection problem under Windows. This is not a hadoop problem neither a docker problem. Please, if available, switch to an Ubuntu or Mac environment.

P.S.: There is a copy of finished output of `run.sh` called `SampleOutput` FYI.

To start, just type `./run.sh`

Enjoy!
